he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said  "that's a lie" just a boy in a chevy truck that had a tendency of gettin' stuck on back roads at night and i was right there beside him all summer long and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone  but when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me  september saw a month of tears and thankin' god that you weren't here to see me like that but in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read from three summers back it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet and lookin' back on all of that  it's nice to believe  when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me  and i'm back for the first time since then i'm standin' on your street and there's a letter left on your doorstep and the first thing that you'll read is  when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song someday you'll turn your radio on i hope it takes you back to that place when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me  oh  think of me mmmm  he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said  "that's a lie"  i

another picture to burn  there's no time for tears i'm just sitting here planning my revenge there's nothing stopping me from going out with all of your best friends and if you come around saying sorry to me my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be  'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn  and if you're missing me you'd better keep it to yourself 'cause coming back around here would be bad for your

i'm needing everything that we should be  i'll bet she's beautiful  that girl he talks about and she's got everything that i have to live without  drew talks to me i laugh 'cause it's just so funny that i can't even see anyone when he's with me  he says he's so in love  he's finally got it right i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night  he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do  drew walks by me can he tell that i can't breathe and there he goes  so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be  she better hold him tight  give him all her love look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause  he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do  so  i drive home alone as i turn out the light i'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight  'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do  he's the time taken up  but there's never enough and he's all that i need to fall into  drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won't see  i don't know what i want  so don't ask me cause i'm still trying to figure it out don't know what's down this road  i'm just walking trying to see through the rain coming down even though i'm not the only one who feels the way i do  chorus i'm alone  on my own  and that's all i know i'll be strong  i'll be wrong  oh but life goes on oh  i'm just a girl  trying to find a place in this world  got the radio on  my old blue jeans and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve feeling lucky today  got the sunshine could you tell me what more do i need and tomorrow's just a mystery  oh yeah but that's ok  chorus  maybe i'm just a girl on a mission but i'm ready to fly  i'm alone  on my own  and that's all i know i'll be strong  i'll be wrong  oh but life goes on oh i'm alone  on my own  and that's all i know oh i'm just a girl  trying to find a place in this world  you have a way of coming easily to me and when you take  you take the very best of me so i start a fight 'cause i need to feel something and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted  oh  what a shame  what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away  no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you  you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and i stood there loving you and wished them all away and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you  oh  what a shame  what a rainy ending given to a perfect day so  just walk away  no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you  you never did give a damn thing  honey  but i cried  cried for you and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died  died for you  died for you  oh  what a shame  what a rainy ending given to a perfect day every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you  i didn't know what i would find when i went looking for a reason  i know i didn't read between the lines and  baby  i've got nowhere to go  i tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times am i right  so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in and i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside  you saw me there  but never knew that i would give it all up to be a part of this  a part of you and now it's all too late so you see  you could've helped if you had wanted to but no one notices until it's too late to do anything  so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in and i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside  oh  yeah  so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in and i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in and i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside  seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty is the face in the mirror looking back at you you walk around here thinking you're not pretty but that's not true 'cause i know you  hold on  baby  you're losing it the water's high  you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry  but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone  i guess it's true that love was all you wanted 'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain  oh  'cause it's not his price to pay it's not his price to pay  hold on  baby  you're losing it the water's high  you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry  but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone  hold on  baby  you're losing it the water's high  you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry  but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone  you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone goodbye  baby with a smile  baby  baby  it's strange to think the songs we used to sing the smiles  the flowers  everything is gone yesterday i found out about you even now just looking at you feels wrong  you say that you'd take it all back  given one chance it was a moment of weakness and you said  "yes"  you should've said "no"  you should've gone home you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go you should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me get back to me and i should've been there in the back of your mind i shouldn't be asking myself  "why" you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should've said "no"  baby  and you might still have me  you can see that i've been crying and baby  you know all the right things to say but do you honestly expect me to believe we could ever be the same  you say that the past is the past  you need one chance it was a moment of weakness and you said  "yes"  you should've said "no"  you should've gone home you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go you should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd  get back to me get back to me and i should've been there in the back of your mind i shouldn't be asking myself  "why" you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should've said "no"  baby  and you might still have me  i can't resist before you go  tell me this was it worth it was she worth this  no no  no  no  you should've said "no"  you should've gone home you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go you should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd  get back to me get back to me and i should've been there in the back of your mind i shouldn't be asking myself  "why" you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should've said "no"  baby  and you might still have me  i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel the other on my heart i look around  turn the radio down he says  "baby is something wrong" i say  "nothing i was just thinking how we don't have a song" and he says  chorus our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late  tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date "man  i didn't kiss her  when i should have" and when i got home  'fore i said  "amen" asking god if he could play it again  i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day had gone all wrong and been trampled on and lost and thrown away got to the hallway  well  on my way to my lovin' bed i almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said  our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late  tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date "man  i didn't kiss her  when i should have" and when i got home  'fore i said  "amen" asking god if he could play it again  i've heard every album  listened to the radio waited for something to come along that was as good as our song  'cause our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late  tapping on his window when we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'cause it's late and his mama don't know our song is the way he laughs the first date "man  i didn't kiss him  when i should have" and when i got home  'fore i said  "amen" asking god if he could play it again play it again  oh  yeah oh-oh  yeah  i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car i grabbed a pen and an old napkin and i wrote down our song  friday night beneath the stars in a field behind your yard you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky and sometimes we don't say a thing just listen to the crickets sing everything i need is right here by my side  and i know everything about you i don't wanna live without you  i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well  you drive me crazy half the time the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me when i'm with you  just a small town boy and girl livin' in a crazy world tryna figure out what is and isn't true and i don't try to hide my tears  the secrets or my deepest fears through it all nobody gets me like you do  and you know everything about me you say that you can't live without me  i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well  you drive me crazy half the time the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me when i'm with you  when i'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself and only you can tell  that i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well  you drive me crazy half the time the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me who i wanna be well  i'm only me when i'm with you  with you  she can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile she'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by  and you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her  but you are everything to me  and i just wanna show you she don't even know you  she's never gonna love you like i want to and you just see right through me  but if you only knew me

i think about is how to make you think of me  and everything that we could be  i just wanna show you she don't even know you  she's never gonna love you like i want to and you just see right through
